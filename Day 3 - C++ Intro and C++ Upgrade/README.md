# C++ Intro and C++11 Upgrade

There are two projects used to demonstrate upgrading from "old" style C++ (roughly C++98/03) to C++11.

Open the project group file (CPP11Upgrade.groupproj) to open both projects.

Old code
========

There is a single page of code (sized to a single screenful of code) in DoStuff() in OldCodeExample.cpp.  It demonstrates containers, functors, iterators, and new/delete, but many of these should be changed for better code.

New code
========

The same DoStuff() method but now in NewCodeExample.cpp has been changed to use uniform initialization syntax, a lambda, range based for loop and auto, and a smart pointer. See the boot camp video on Youtube for an explanation of all the coding choices that were made here - it fully explains the code.
